# Rust for Node.js Developers

> Examples of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) examples compared to [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for learning.

This guide full of examples is intended for people learning Rust that are coming from Node.js, although the vice versa can work too. This is not meant to be a complete guide and it is assumed that you've gone through the [Getting Started of Rust]() tutorial. This guide is meant to be barely good enough to help you at a 
high level understand how to do X in Y and doing further learning on your own is of course required.
